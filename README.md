Intermediate Ruby on Rails
================

Welcome to thoughtbot's Intermediate Ruby on Rails workshop!

This repository is where you'll do your work for the app you'll build for the workshop.

Fork this private repo into your own Github Account. 
If you don't know how to do this, there are [instructions on GitHub](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo)

Our version of this repository is empty except for this README and thats the point. By working in your own fork of this
repository we'll be able to see the code you're writing, answer questions, and even comment on it.

Other students in the workshop will also be able to see the code you're writing if they browse to your fork.

If you have any questions at all, access the private Campfire chat, email learn@thoughtbot.com, or 
attend the weekly office hours. However, don't wait until the office hours if you get stuck or 
have questions, we're here to help you!
